# Listing Page

Listing pages are automatically created when an `isPartOf` is filled in your content. But, you may want to customize this listing page with specific contents or title and description for SEO purposes for example.

Here an example of how to create a listing page :

```markdown:index.mdx
---
name: My website category
description: This category will help you find relevant content about the category topic.
identifier: category
inLanguage: en
listingPage: true
dateCreated: 2023-11-11T09:50:33.571Z
dateModified: 2023-11-11T09:51:19.968Z

Additional contents. The content will be listed below or a above depending on the theme project used.
