# Create Your Blog Template

Jumpstart your Galactiks template developer journey by crafting your unique blog template.

## Fork the Starter Repository

Begin by forking the [Blog Template Repository](https://github.com/thegalactiks/blog-template) on GitHub. This repository serves as the foundation for your new blog template.

Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contentlayer-starter.git
```

Now you can start developing your own template.

## Develop

## Publish

For now, you only have to push on Github but a proper publishing process will be defined.
